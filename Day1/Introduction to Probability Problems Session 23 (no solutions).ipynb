    "As astronomers, we know that there are two exclusively correct theories of nature. Classical mechanics and general relativity and no others. Given that both of these theories are deterministic, from where does randomnness come from? \n",
    "\n",
    "One way that people have approached this question is by positing that randomness (or probability) are empirical facts - something we see in the behaivor of a rolled die or a flipped coin. In fact, if we flip a coin a large number of times, it does approach a 1/2 H 1/2 T distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "This has never quite made sense to me. We assume that both outcomes are equally likely based on the principle of indifference. But a coin is not in an indifferent starting state - one side is typically face up before you flip it. How can we explain the equally likely outcomes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by writing down the equations of motion for the coin as it moves through the air (and rotates). Once you have done that, plot the 'pre-image' (space of initial conditions) that lead to H and T outcomes. Explain why coins have a 1/2 H and 1/2 T long-run distribution and speculate on the origin of randomness. "
